            <p align="justify">My name is Honest! My name is a cobversation starter, not a surprise, right? As you'd expect, introducing myself always gets the response "are you honest". Well, literally I am (I mean, that's my name, right?). I jest, but to seriously, I can only say that the name is an inspiration as I try my best to live up to it. You can say justify it the best I can.
</p>
<p align="justify">
My personality; I see myself as an introvert. While I can spend hours insolitude without craving the company of anyone, I still have my moments when I want to be communual. And I do well in groups and teams. So, am I really introverted or just one who loves some "me-time" every now and then. Well, lets leave that to the psychologists.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Professionally, I've experience in many sectors, from doing my SIWES (internship), at a bank, then a telecom service provider to working as a systems administrator and then a Self-Service Channels Engineer/Consultant. So, I am a man of many crafts and experiences. In keeping with that unwind with doing graphic designs on Corel Suites, (oh the good old flash and fireworks).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    I have many aspirations, one of which is to add valuable tech skills to my many crafts. This informed my decision to enrol at Altschool Africa. So, I currently a student at AltSchool School of Engineering, the institution that's redefining education using tech.
